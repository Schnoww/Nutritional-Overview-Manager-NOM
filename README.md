# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Nutritional-Overview-Manager-NOM-
We present NOM (Nutritional Overview Manager) to innovate the student experience with the dining services at the University of New Haven by applying user-interface, user-experience (UI/UX) principles and best practices. The existing system does not provide accurate, current, complete, and detailed information about dining services. This situation creates frustration and confusion among students, especially those with allergies or cultural restrictions. This along with the need to manually update the website makes the current system unintuitive. It also lacks accessibility features and options to meet student's needs. Our goal is to streamline the process of managing dietary challenges, viewing real-time information on dining facilities, accessing menu options, and providing a comprehensive and personalized application tailored to students. We will design and implement an application via a React website and a React-Native mobile application as an online portal for students and university food service workers. Users will safely access the portal via Single-Sign On (SSO) in order to interact using Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) with the university enterprise ecosystem. A major challenge of our project is centered around secure system interaction, data integrity, and user activity traceability. To overcome this challenge, our project will leverage the expertise of faculty, IT professionals, and dining service administrators. NOM aims to offer a rich and unique dining experience for students from the University of New Haven. In the future, we plan to extend the service of NOM to support multiple institutions and include additional user experience feedback and reviews.
